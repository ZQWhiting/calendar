# Work Day Scheduler
This is a work day scheduler program designed to allow the user to add important tasks to a daily planner allowing better time management. The program also color indicates the past, present, and future tasks in real time to help the user see which tasks to focus on.

## Usage
Click on any of the task boxes to focus on a textbox meant for storing tasks and type in whatever tasks you want. To save the task, click the save button icon to the right of the row, which corresponds to the row in which it resides. If the save button is not clicked, then the task will not be saved and will instead be erased if the page is refreshed. Otherwise, after being saved, the tasks will persist in the local storage.

The color indicators are updated on the hour in real time and require no user interaction.
